# quantum-networks-optimization
This folder contains the programs needed to perform the optimization procedure as described in the paper [npj Quantum Inf 10, 44 (2024)].
This folder contains two subfolders.
In "average_properties", there is the program needed to reproduce the results in the paper.
In "optimize", there is a program which can be used to find the optimal network given a set of points and a given set of parameters.
